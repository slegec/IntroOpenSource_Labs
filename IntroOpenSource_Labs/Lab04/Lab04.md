Maintaining good documentation is important because it helps the user understand
what is supposed to be happening when they are unsure of it's usage.  More importantly,
consistency is also a key.  Chaning the way a word is written can imply unintended meanings,
which can confuse the reader.  Maintaining open source code allows people to use the code
throughout the future and enables users to add on to it with ease.
