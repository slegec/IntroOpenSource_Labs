#Lab 08

Project Status:

For my project, I am currently able to download almost all files from one course
and store those files to their corresponding folder.  The next steps for me include implmenting
a recursive call to make sure I get all the files embedded in sub dirs on LMS.  In addition,
I need to make it so the files previously downloaded are tracked, and either not redownloaded, or are simply
overwritten.
