*2. Why it is important to choose a LICENSE?*

It is very important to choose a license with open source software because without one,
a larger company (or an individual) can not legally modify and use your code without your
permission.  The license is what gives them the proper permissions, and tells them what they
are and are not allowed to do with the code.


*3. Why they SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license*

If there is no license, and you use their code, you could technically risk a lawsuit from the
original developer.  Generally, people assume that if it is open source code on github, you should be
OK, but if it doesn't have a license, you are taking a risk.


*4. Do you agree with this claim?*

I agree with this claim, because generally open source software tends to take off and be used/developed
by many users.  In the case of Gopher, disagreements about how the software should be worked on led to
it's demise.  When it eventually split, it basically spelled the end for it.


*5. Can you justify why such a license is chosen?*

For Linux, the GPL v2 license makes sense.  You are allowed to modify and redistribute a new or modified
distro of Linux for your own custom use.  For instance, if you are in a warehouse, and you need your
machines to be running a customized OS/software that is specifically for your company, it would be beneficial
to be able to optimize this for your use.  Hence why the GPL license allows this.
