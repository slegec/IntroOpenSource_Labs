*2. Why it is important to choose a LICENSE?*

It is very important to choose a license with open source software because without one,
a larger company (or an individual) can not legally modify and use your code without your
permission.  The license is what gives them the proper permissions, and tells them what they
are and are not allowed to do with the code.


*3. Why they SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license*

If there is no license, and you use their code, you could technically risk a lawsuit from the
original developer.  Generally, people assume that if it is open source code on github, you should be
OK, but if it doesn't have a license, you are taking a risk.


*4. Do you agree with this claim?*

I agree with this claim, because generally open source software tends to take off and be used/developed
by many users.  In the case of Gopher, disagreements about how the software should be worked on led to
it's demise.  When they began to make people pay for a license, it killed their service, allowing the internet
to take off.


*5. Can you justify why such a license is chosen?*

For Linux, the GPL v2 license makes sense.  You are allowed to modify and redistribute a new or modified
distro of Linux for your own custom use.  For instance, if you are in a warehouse, and you need your
machines to be running a customized OS/software that is specifically for your company, it would be beneficial
to be able to optimize this for your use.  Hence why the GPL license allows this.


*6. Choose a license*

MIT


*7. Discuss advantages of GPL, LGPL, and Apache/BSD*

BSD - Software company - When you are fine with people creating closed variants of your code

LGPL - Proprietary Developer - When the software being written can only be used for propreitary uses

GPL - Common Good - When the goal is freedom, someone can borrow a snippet of code, or you want people to contribute to it



*8. Create a repository*

*9. About choosing a project*

A couple of years ago, LMS used to be unreliable; it would go down right before finals or a big test,
so students couldn't access files their professors posted.  In addition, some LMS sites are particularly
hard to navigate (ex. LITEC).  I have always wanted to be able to automatically download all the files foor
a course in one sititng, without going through hundreds of mouse clicks.  This is what I hope my program will
acomplish.

The users of this software would be directly RPI students that have experienced the same struggles that I have had.

I chose the MIT license because it is really open.  It will allow other students that use the Blackboard (LMS)
system to modify it for teir own use at their own schools.
